# Design Preferences
- User prefers minimalistic design systems with square corners (no border-radius), extra light backgrounds (from a 5-color palette), and maximum layout compactness for professional dashboard aesthetics.
- User prefers unified design systems across micro-frontends with shared CSS variables/design tokens.
- User wants consistent styling between standalone and federated modes.

# Application Startup
- The micro-frontends application startup sequence requires building and serving Tasks remote on port 5081 first (npm run build && npm run preview), then building and starting the Host application on port 5080 (npm run build && npm run dev) to consume the remote via Module Federation.

# TypeScript Architecture
- Organize the project structure following domain-driven design principles
